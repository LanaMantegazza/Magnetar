# ðŸŒŒ Magnetar (Multi-Agent General NLP Engine forming a Turing-complete ARchitecture)

---

## Introduction

Magnetar is a project that uses multiple AI agents that work in a heirarchical structure to accomplish a given task.
Please see the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) file for a detailed description of how the AI agents work. I will update this section once the project is in a state where it can be used.

---

## Overview

As of now, the project is in its infancy with the core idea being crystallized in CONCEPT.md. The implementation of the AI agents is currently underway, and I'm hoping to upload a functional project soon!

---

## Installation

The project is not ready for installation at this time. This section will be updated as soon as I have something ready for you to try out.

---
